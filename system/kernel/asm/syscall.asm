[extern system_call]
global syscall_entry

; We are implementing system calls using `Fast System Calls`. Even if this
; implies using `sysenter` and `sysexit` - hence working in x86 CPUs, we do
; not expect this project from ever reaching a stage where kernel/user mode
; in all CPUs is required.
; In oppposition to using interrupts for system calls, the `sys` instructions
; are not copying register. Thus, a lot of the code below is linked to
; register managment.
; WARN: This code expects a C function call `system_call` to be defined since
; it will be the function called to manage the syscall.
; WARN: This expects to run in ring 3
; INFO: The sysenter instruction is not present here since this piece of code
; will be ran
