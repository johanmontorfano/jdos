# Johan's Dumb Operating System

**JDOS is an operating system made from scratch, its intended to have the
following features at some point:**
- Disk I/O
- Graphical User Interface
- Applications
- User Mode

### Compilation

To properly compile the system, call `make`. To run it, call `make run`.

If you are trying to use HDD-based bootloader/kernel, call `make run_hdd`
instead.

If you have trouble running the OS (loop), try removig `hdd.bin` and
recompiling. In some cases, `hdd.bin` content can be causing issues.

### OS Specifications

##### Drivers

Drivers, depending on their kind, have to operate with buffers.

##### Buffers

Buffers are objects used by the kernel to keep track of input/outputs making
possible for libc to abstract stuff like `getline`.

| Buffer name      | Buffer Description                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **stdin**        | Stores keyboard/mouse input data              |
| **stdout**       | Stores printed data                           |
| **stderr**       | Stores printed data categorized as errors     |

Every buffer can be flushed by a program/the kernel.
